When is it acceptable to use CamelCase?

  Only in class names.


When do we use do...end instead of {...}?

  When our block cannot comfortably fit onto a single line.


In Test::Unit, what is the difference between assert and assert_equal?

  assert allows us to check if some arbitrary condition is true.

  assert_equal tests if two conditions are equal and fails if they aren't.


Where do we put code that needs to be run before or after each test?

  Inside of the setup and teardown methods.


When we use setup, why do we need to use instance variables?

  To reduce redundant code. The filler data for tests is created by setup and
  assigned to instance variables, which are available to test methods.


How do you run all the specs in a folder?




What is a stub?




What is a mock?




Why do we make sure that our tests are red before fixing them?




If your company won’t allow full tests, what does it mean to “exercise your code, even just a little bit.”
