In your own words, what is AJAX and why is it worth knowing about?

  It allows for dynamic content to be loaded on the page without the user being
  subjected to a page refresh. Data can be pulled from a server using Javascript
  and inserted into the page.

  The data pulled is in either JSON or XML form, which is read by the JavaScript
  and parsed into new DOM elements

  The A in its name stands for "Asynchronous". AJAX is different from most other
  JavaScript in that it is not executed in the order that it appears. Instead,
  the script continues running while the HTTP request is being served. The new
  content is then inserted later on. This prevents AJAX from locking up the
  browser during the time data is being retrieved.

What is JSON and why do we love it?

  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is essentially a hash. It is a native
  JavaScript format in which data representing objects is transferred.

  It accepts strictly-formatted sets of key-value pairs. The keys and any values
  that are strings must be enclosed in double quotes.

  JSON is awesome because of the concise, lightweight format it uses. It is
  extremely easy for humans to read, and JavaScript transfers and processes it
  efficiently.


What function do we use to download a JSON snippet from a server?

  .getJSON() retrieves the desired file and parses it from the JSON string
  representation into a JavaScript object.

after it finishes downloading?
