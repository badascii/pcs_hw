What is “progressive enhancement”?

    It describes the process of building a website's core HTML functionality
    first, and then adding styling and animation improvements later on. This
    prevents undesired effects such as when a user does not have JavaScript.
    If core features are tied to the JavaScript the site will cease to
    work properly.


How do you bind a click event to a button?

    $('button').on('click', function(){});


Inside a click handler, what is the variable this set to?

    The DOM element that is handling the click event.


What is event bubbling?

    It is when an event first acts on the single element that was targeted,
    after which the event progressively applies to the parent elements of the
    original element, working its way up successively. This expansion of
    scope mimics a bubble growing larger, hence the name.


How do we stop an event from bubbling up the chain?

    Pass a variable (usually named event or e, although any name will do) to the
    function and then call .stopPropogation() on it.


How do we stop an element from taking its default action (e.g. a submit button
will refresh the page or submit a form)

    By calling the .preventDefault() function on the event variable.


How do we remove a binding?

    By calling the .unbind() function and passing it the event we want to unbind
    as an argument.

    The .one() function provides a shortcut that unbinds an event immediately
    after the first time it is triggered.


How do we hide and show elements?

    One method is to alter the CSS directly: .css('display', 'none')

    .hide();

How do we blur or slide elements?

    .fadeToggle()
    .fadeTo()
    .slideDown()
    .slideUp()
    .slideToggle()
