In your own words, summarize the 7 things on page 9-11 that jQuery does well

  1) It quickly and easily traverses the DOM and accesses elements within.

  2) It easily modifies the CSS styling of sites regardless of browser
     technology.

  3) It can directly modify the content of the DOM beyond just styling. The
     actual structure of HTML can be manipulated and images, lists, text, and
     any other elements are able to be dynamically modified.

  4) It intercepts and acts on browser events (such as a click or mouse hover)
     when they happen and eliminates the inconsistent behavior seen across
     varied browsers.

  5) It provides a variety of tools that allow for visual feedback and
     interactive animations when the user manipulates a page.

  6) It allows for developers to easily implement Ajax (dynamic client-server
     communication and refreshing of individual elements without refreshing the
     entire page). jQuery eliminates the complicated task of adapting Ajax
     to the behavior of each particular browser, which normally all implement it
     in different ways.

  7) It enhances and simplifies basic JavaScript tasks that are commonly used.
