What is recursion?

  A method that calls itself until a condition is met.


When learning recursion, what is the defacto “hello world” style program?

  Computing factorials.


Use pseudo code to complete a recursive sort

  def sort(array, directions)
    if array.empty?
      return
    else
      directions = sort(array[0], )

What does + do to a Time object?

  It increases that object in seconds by the number being added.


Explain what the epoch is. When does the epoch end? What happened to 30-year
house loans in 2008?

  It is the arbitrary point at the start of 1970 that computers count the number
  of seconds from (aka the date that computers believe the world began). It was
  implemented due to restrictions in how large numbers could be at the time.

  It ends in January 2038.

  Those loans became incompatible with systems that rely upon the epoch.


How is a Hash different from an Array?

  A hash is a set of keys each assigned their own value, both of which can be
  any object. They are traditionally unordered, but in Ruby 1.9 and up their
  order is remembered.

  An array is an ordered list of elements that are indexed numerically and which
  begin with a 0 index in Ruby.


When using each on a Hash, will objects ways come out in the correct order?

  Traditionally no, but as of Ruby 1.9 they are ordered.

What is a Range? How do you puts all the numbers from 0 to 26?

  It is an interval of numbers or letter characters in string form.

  puts (0..26)

What is the difference between Time.now.class and Time.class?

  Time.now.class returns the class of an instance of Time, which is Time.

  Time.class returns the class of the Time class, which is Class.
