What is your favorite color?

  Blue or maybe red haha.


How old are you in seconds? (If you did this with only a calculator how would you do it?)

  28.17 (age in years, with months converted to a decimal) * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 888,369,120 seconds


What is a String?

  A collection of zero or more letters, numbers, or symbols (not symbol in the Ruby sense, although those
  do have a string representation) that is the literal text representation of its contents.


Whatâ€™s the difference between single and double-quoted strings?

  Single quotes don't interpolate values with #{}. The only thing you can embed in single quotes is an
  escaped single quote and the backslash itself.

  Double quotes do interpolation and can escape many other characters (such as \t for tab and \n for newline).


How do you use a quote mark inside of a string? (escaping characters)

  1) "The old man yelled, \"Get off my damn lawn!\""

  2) 'Don\'t take my word for it.'

  3) %q{I'm not sure I approve of that there fancy "escaped text."}

  4) %Q{"Wow, I can't believe it's already #{Time.now}!," he said tiredly.}


What is a variable?

  A sequence of letters or numbers that point to an object or value.


How do you put a variable inside a string? (interpolation or concatenation)

  "Hello #{user.name}"


What does the to_s or the to_i method do and why do we need them? (type casting)

  They respectively return the string and integer versions of the objects they are called on.
  to_i returns only the first integer or sequence of integers when called on a string.

  These methods allow us to convert data so that it may gain access to type-specific methods.


Odds:

Why is 2 < 10 #=> true but '2' < '10' #=> false? (lexicographical ordering)

  The '1' character is lower in order than the '2' character. The '0' has no effect here as the comparison
  only checks the ordering of the first character in the strings.


What are the only two values that evaluate to false in Ruby? (falsy values)

  false and nil


What happens if you use = instead of == in a conditional?

  It will assign a value instead of checking for equality. The conditional will not function properly.


If you end up executing an infinite loop how do you stop it? (SIGKILL)

  Ctrl + C


Why would you ever want to use while true?

  To create a loop.


What do the && and || operators do? (logical operators)

  && verifies that the conditions on both sides of the operator are true before proceeding.

  || only requires one of the two conditions to be true.


What is the difference between if !false and unless false? (logical not)

  It is harder to parse !false. Using unless makes the control structure easier to
  understand and requires less actors.


What is an array?

  An ordered and indexed collection of any objects.


What does it mean for an array to be zero indexed?

  The first index (ie the leftmost value) is referenced with 0 instead of 1.


What is the method in 8.1 we use to walk over all values in an array?

  each


What do push, pop, and last do? Is there a first?

  push - destructively adds an element to the end of an array and returns that array

  pop - destructively removes the last element of an array and returns that element

  last - returns the last element of an array

  Yes, with unshift and shift being the equivalent destructive instance methods for the front of an array.
