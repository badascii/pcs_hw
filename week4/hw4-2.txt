What is a test spy? Is it closer to a mock or a stub? Or neither?

  A spy monitors a function and reports information on it when the test is done.
  It is somewhere in between mocks and stubs. Spies can fulfill the needs that
  both stubs and mocks. Sinon also provides the functionality that all three
  provide.


How do you use a spy to facilitate the concept of mocking?




Why would we watch objects to find out if certain functions have been called?

  So that we can track the flow of our program. It is important to know if
  things are working properly and the code written is doing what it is expected
  to do.


What are the use cases for mocks in Javascript? Are they different from Ruby?

  Mocks are used for AJAX, HTML loading, and other events where files or servers
  are being accessed and content is being loaded dynamically. User input and
  dynamic are the biggest differences between JavaScript and Ruby. Testing these
  things is an important and unique part of writing programs and web apps that
  use JavaScript.
